A solution for QoS-aware web service composition

This solution is for simulation of web service composition. Reading from a text file which includes the dataset,
the composition request is generated and can be processed by any algorithm wich implements our domain. I have
currently developed 3 libraries to perform the composition task using 3 different evolutionary algorithms including
ICA (Imperialist Competitive Algorithm), PSO (Paritcle Swarm Optimization) and DPSO (Discrete PSO).
